Get the files in the repo to your local system.

Create a Clarion project and compile.  If you use the supplied project then nothing else is needed, if you create your own add the c_bcp.lib to the project.

Added some data types

tinyint,
smallint,
real,
dateTime,
time(n)

feel free to send any questions or comments to me,
